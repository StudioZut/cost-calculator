A simple js tool for cost calculations, forked from my work on the GW Libraries Cultural Imaginings Project (around 2011?). 

The index.php page doesn't seem to contain any php, so you could rename the file extension and it should run. 

The main functions for the calculator are in the index file. Most of the other files are related to the larger project and aren't needed. 

Check the bottom of the index file for any js files that need to load.
